Used the following documentation: 

https://www.linuxbuzz.com/install-minikube-on-ubuntu/

First I tried to setup minikube on Manjaro but it failed a few times due du different errors. 
Decided to setup a VM with ubuntu. 

Installed openssh server and connected via SSH into the VM. 
First I had to install curl after setting up ubuntu and checking the connection. 

Installed docker, minikube, kubectl and was very quickly able to get started with minikube.
